# Infinity_Mirror

An infinity mirror project built using a WS2812b RGB LED strip and an ESP32 using PlatformIO. The inital code is taken from:
https://github.com/Resseguie/FastLED-Patterns

## Todo
- [X] Add Swirly pattern - group x pixels that rotate around the strip y times.
- [X] Add Spinny pattern - two groups of Swirlies counterrotating in sync. (Optional functionality of Swirly.)
- [ ] Add Trippy pattern - two groups of Swirlies counterrotating out of sync.
