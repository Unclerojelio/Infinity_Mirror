# Infinity_Mirror

An infinity mirror project built using a WS2812b RGB LED strip and an ESP32 using PlatformIO. The inital code is taken from:
https://github.com/Resseguie/FastLED-Patterns

## Todo
Add Swirly pattern - group x pixels that rotate around the strip y times.
Add Spinny pattern - two groups of Swirlies counterrotating in sync.
Add Trippy pattern - two groups of Swirlies counterrotating out of sync.
